- q: What is the average response time for a PMP Gateway request?
  a: The response time for PMP Gateway requests depends directly on the response time of the PMP(s) being queried. The response can be only as fast as the slowest PMP. In general, the average response time is about 6 or 7 seconds for a search request.
- q: How long should I wait for a response from PMP Gateway?
  a: You should wait at least 30 seconds for a PMP Gateway response. PMP Gateway may request data from multiple state PMP systems and consequently, can respond only as quickly as the slowest state PMP system it queries.

- q: Should I include optional XML elements in my requests?
  a: Yes, include as many of the optional XML elements as you can. Different states use different elements to reteive data and including optional elements will improve the results you receive. Additionally, in the future, states may change the elements they use. Including the optional elements now will prevent possible errors in the future.
- q: How are PMP prescription records matched to the patient data I supply?
  a: The logic behind patient matching is performed at the PMP level and can vary between PMPs. PMP Gateway does not perform any matching or filtering - it takes the results from each PMP, aggregates them and sends you the result.
