    <h1>Architecture (of the PMP network)</h1>
    <p>PMP Gateway gets prescription data from a distributed network of state PMP systems. This section explains the architecture of the PMP network and how PMP Gateway fits into it.</p>

    <p><strong>State PMP Systems</strong> store prescription data for patients and allow authorized users to request or commit prescription data.</p>
    <p><strong><%= link_to 'PMP Interconnect', 'http://www.nabp.net/programs/pmp-interconnect/nabp-pmp-interconnect' %></strong> facilitates communications between state PMP systems. One role of PMP Interconnect is to manage permissions for how state PMP systems communicate with each other.</p>
    <p><strong>PMP Gateway</strong> connects to PMP Interconnect, providing an interface for healthcare providers to query patient prescription data.</p>

      <h3>Consequences of Distributed Architecture</h3>
      <p>The distributed architecture of the PMP system impacts how PMP Gateway functions. Some of the consequences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prescription data requests can only be as fast as the slowest PMP being queried. Consequently, the average response time is 7 seconds.</li>
        <li>Errors may occur at any point in the network. XML Responses will describe where in the network an error occured.</li>
      </ul>
