QUESTIONS

Why is the test domain name so wonky?
 - current: https://gateway-test.pmp.appriss.com
 - why not: https://test.pmpgateway.net

How are requests for different versions handled?
  different paths
  server processing
are requests sent to:
  https://gateway-test.pmp.appriss.com
  https://pmpgateway.net
automatically handled as v5 or does the user need to send request to
  https://gateway-test.pmp.appriss.com/v5
  https://pmpgateway.net/v5

Can I change the v4 endpoint
  from: https://gateway-prep.pmp.appriss.com
  to: https://gateway-test.pmp.appriss.com/v5


Why is this element necessary?
    <Provider>
      <LocationStateCode>OH</LocationStateCode>
There is already:
    <Location>
      ...
      <Address>
        ...
        <StateCode>KS</StateCode>
LocationStateCode is optional (excluded from the min example) and redundant.
